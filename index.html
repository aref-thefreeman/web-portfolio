            <p>
                Hi, I'm Jonas! I have been identified as one of Udemy's Top Instructors and all my premium courses have recently earned the best-selling status for outstanding performance and student satisfaction.
                
                I'm a full-stack web developer and designer with a passion for building beautiful things from scratch. I've been building websites and apps since 2007 and also have a Master's degree in Engineering.
                
                It was in college where I first discovered my passion for teaching and helping others by sharing all I knew. And that passion brought me to Udemy in 2015, where my students love the fact that I take the time to explain important concepts in a way that everyone can easily understand.
                
                Do you want to learn how to build awesome websites with advanced HTML and CSS?
                
                Looking for a complete JavaScript course that takes you from beginner to advanced developer?
                
                Or maybe you want to build modern and fast back-end applications with Node.js?
                
                Then don't waste your time with random tutorials or incomplete videos. All my courses are easy-to-follow, all-in-one packages that will take your skills to the next level.
